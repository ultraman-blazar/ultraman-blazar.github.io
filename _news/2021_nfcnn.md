Our paper, entitled **NFCNN: Toward a Noise Fusion Convolutional Neural Network for Image Denoising**, proposes a Noise Fusion Convolutional Neural Network (NFCNN) designed for image denoising. Compared to existing methods, NFCNN demonstrates a notable advantage in preserving texture details. This work has been accepted for publication in Signal, Image and Video Processing, a journal published by Springer.
