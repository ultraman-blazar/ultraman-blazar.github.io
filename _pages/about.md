As an **R&D Scientist** at **Ubisoft La Forge**, I specialize in **Machine Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and **Computer Graphics**, with a strong focus on advancing the frontiers of game asset creation. My work spans **low-level image processing**, **high-level vision tasks**, and the application of **diffusion models**, all aimed at developing innovative technologies for asset generation and processing.

I expertise in **AI-Generated Content (AIGC)** and **High-fidelity Asset Processing** to achieve production-ready quality contents. My interests lie in applied research: identifying real-world production challenges, designing novel solutions, and deploying these innovations into practical tools and workflows to enable more refined and controllable content generation.

In addition to my research, I have the privilege of mentoring research students during their internships, providing hands-on guidance in those rapidly advancing fields. We are consistently looking to forge collaborations with motivated Master's and PhD candidates who are passionate about pushing the boundaries of knowledge and contributing to novel solutions in Generative AI and Computer Vision.
